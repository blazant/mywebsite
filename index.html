        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently an A-level student studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Business. I've been told
            for the most of my life that I can't do everything or be everything. As you can imagine a kid with massive goals like me,
            It was certainly news I'll tell you that. But it was one I would later learn to accept and try to disprove. Just look at my subject 
            combination. Anyways swiftly moving on from that topic, I hope to be an entrepreneur one day who asides from making loads of cash,
            also have the ability to create my own tech or gadget. Just like... BATMAN. Joking, Not Joking haha. My clothing brand is Two and the socials will be
            displayed somewhere below. I also have a page where I talk about everything business. Not your slimely A-level business but discussing the strategic moves 
            of different businesses and their possible impacts ofcourse using the knowlege I have acquired for the aforementioned subject. The link to the socials of this page if 
            you are interested and would like to be apart of it will also be below. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Truely a resiliant bugger as I am truely and truely a time 
            waster. My business however is no joke. Trust.
